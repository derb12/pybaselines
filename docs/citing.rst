The following Bibtex entry can be used for citing pybaselines in published
research:

.. code-block:: text

    @software{pybaselines,
      author = {Erb, Donald},
      doi = {10.5281/zenodo.5608581},
      title = {{pybaselines}: A {Python} library of algorithms for the baseline correction of experimental data},
      url = {https://github.com/derb12/pybaselines}
      version = {1.1.0}
    }

The resulting citation would look something like:

.. code-block:: text

    Erb, D. (2024). pybaselines: A Python library of algorithms for the baseline correction of
    experimental data. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5608581.

The above DOI is valid for all versions of pybaselines. If citing a specific version,
the DOI can be found on the project's Zenodo page: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5608581.

In addition, the original source publication for any used algorithm should likewise be
cited; all algorithms in pybaselines provide the source publications within the docstring
for easy lookup.
