The following Bibtex entry can be used for citing pybaselines in published
research:

.. code-block:: text

    @software{pybaselines,
      author = {Erb, Donald},
      doi = {10.5281/zenodo.5608581},
      title = {{pybaselines}: A {Python} library of algorithms for the baseline correction of experimental data},
      url = {https://github.com/derb12/pybaselines}
    }

The resulting citation would look something like:

.. code-block:: text

    Erb, D. pybaselines: A Python library of algorithms for the baseline correction of
    experimental data. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5608581.

.. note::

  Please note that the name pybaselines is intentionally not capitalized to maintain consistency
  with early citations to the package before citation guidelines were considered, so styling
  it as "Pybaselines" or "PyBaselines" is very much not preferred for the sake of consistency.

The above DOI is valid for all versions of pybaselines. If citing a specific version,
the DOI can be found on the project's Zenodo page: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5608581.

In addition, the original source publication for any used algorithm should likewise be
cited; all algorithms in pybaselines provide the source publications within the docstring
for easy lookup.
