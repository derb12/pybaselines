This section of the documentation is to help provide some context for each algorithm.
In addition, most algorithms will have a figure that shows how well the algorithm fits
various datasets to help choose the correct algorithm for a particular baseline. These datasets
include noisy data, data with both positive and negative peaks, data with overlapping peaks,
and concave data, and they serve as a way to quickly filter out algorithms that would not
work for a particular dataset.
