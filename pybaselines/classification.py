        Golotvin's method for identifying baseline regions.

        Divides the data into sections and takes the minimum standard deviation of all
        sections as the noise standard deviation for the entire data. Then classifies any point
        where the rolling max minus min is less than ``num_std * noise standard deviation``
        as belonging to the baseline.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (N,)
            The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
        half_window : int, optional
            The half-window to use for the rolling maximum and rolling minimum calculations.
            Should be approximately equal to the full-width-at-half-maximum of the peaks or
            features in the data. Default is None, which will use half of the value from
            :func:`.optimize_window`, which is not always a good value, but at least scales
            with the number of data points and gives a starting point for tuning the parameter.
        num_std : float, optional
            The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Higher values
            will assign more points as baseline. Default is 3.0.
        sections : int, optional
            The number of sections to divide the input data into for finding the minimum
            standard deviation. Default is 32.
        smooth_half_window : int, optional
            The half window to use for smoothing the interpolated baseline with a moving average.
            Default is None, which will use `half_window`. Set to 0 to not smooth the baseline.
        interp_half_window : int, optional
            When interpolating between baseline segments, will use the average of
            ``data[i-interp_half_window:i+interp_half_window+1]``, where `i` is
            the index of the peak start or end, to fit the linear segment. Default is 5.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
            an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
            (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        min_length : int, optional
            Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
            to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
            A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
            Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
        pad_kwargs : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
            the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from smoothing. Default is None.
        **kwargs

            .. deprecated:: 1.2.0
                Passing additional keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in version

        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The calculated baseline.

        smooth_half_window : int, optional

        num_std : float, optional
            The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Higher values
            will assign more points as baseline. Default is 3.0.

        poly_order : int, optional
            The polynomial order for fitting the identified baseline. Default is 5.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations for fitting a polynomial to the identified
            baseline. If `max_iter` is 0, the returned baseline will be just the linear
            interpolation of the baseline segments. Default is 50.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria for fitting a polynomial to the identified baseline points.
            Default is 1e-3.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
            an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
            (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        return_coef : bool, optional
            If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
            a form that fits the input `x_data` and return them in the params dictionary.
            Default is False, since the conversion takes time.
        min_length : int, optional
            Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
            to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
            A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
            Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
        pad_kwargs : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
            the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from smoothing. Default is None.
        **kwargs

            .. deprecated:: 1.2.0
                Passing additional keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in version
                1.4.0. Pass keyword arguments using `pad_kwargs`.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'mask': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
                The boolean array designating baseline points as True and peak points
                as False.
            * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order,)
                Only if `return_coef` is True and `max_iter` is greater than 0. The array
                of polynomial coefficients for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be
                used to create a polynomial using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
                Only if `max_iter` is greater than 1. An array containing the calculated
                tolerance values for each iteration. The length of the array is the number
                of iterations completed. If the last value in the array is greater than
                the input `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

        Notes
        -----
        When choosing parameters, first choose a `smooth_half_window` that appropriately
        smooths the data, and then reduce `num_std` until no peak regions are included in
        the baseline. If no value of `num_std` works, change `smooth_half_window` and repeat.

        If `max_iter` is 0, the baseline is simply a linear interpolation of the identified
        baseline points. Otherwise, a polynomial is iteratively fit through the baseline
        points, and the interpolated sections are replaced each iteration with the polynomial
        fit.

            The half-window to use for the rolling standard deviation calculation. Should
            be approximately equal to the full-width-at-half-maximum of the peaks or features
            in the data. Default is None, which will use half of the value from
            :func:`.optimize_window`, which is not always a good value, but at least scales
            with the number of data points and gives a starting point for tuning the parameter.
        threshold : float or Callable, optional
            All points in the rolling standard deviation below `threshold` will be considered
            as baseline. Higher values will assign more points as baseline. Default is None,
            which will set the threshold as the 15th percentile of the rolling standard
            deviation. If `threshold` is Callable, it should take the rolling standard deviation
            as the only argument and output a float.
        min_fwhm : int, optional
            After creating the interpolated baseline, any region where the baseline
            is greater than the data for `min_fwhm` consecutive points will have an additional
            baseline point added and reinterpolated. Should be set to approximately the
            index-based full-width-at-half-maximum of the smallest peak. Default is None,
            which uses 2 * `half_window`.
        interp_half_window : int, optional
            When interpolating between baseline segments, will use the average of
            ``data[i-interp_half_window:i+interp_half_window+1]``, where `i` is
            the index of the peak start or end, to fit the linear segment. Default is 5.
        smooth_half_window : int, optional
            The half window to use for smoothing the interpolated baseline with a moving average.
            Default is None, which will use `half_window`. Set to 0 to not smooth the baseline.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
            an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
            (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations to attempt to fill in regions where the baseline
            is greater than the input data. Default is 100.
        min_length : int, optional
            Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
            to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
            A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
            Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
        pad_kwargs : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
            the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from smoothing. Default is None.
        **kwargs

            .. deprecated:: 1.2.0
                Passing additional keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in version

        symmetric : bool, optional
            When fitting the identified baseline points with a polynomial, if `symmetric`

            polynomial is greater than the input data for ``N/100`` consecutive points on both

        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have

                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (N,)
            The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
        lam : float, optional
            The smoothing parameter. Larger values will create smoother baselines.
            Default is 1e6.
        scale : int, optional
            The scale at which to calculate the continuous wavelet transform. Should be
            approximately equal to the index-based full-width-at-half-maximum of the peaks
            or features in the data. Default is None, which will use half of the value from
            :func:`.optimize_window`, which is not always a good value, but at least scales
            with the number of data points and gives a starting point for tuning the parameter.
        num_std : float, optional
            The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Higher values
            will assign more points as baseline. Default is 3.0.
        diff_order : int, optional
            The order of the differential matrix. Must be greater than 0. Default is 2
            (second order differential matrix). Typical values are 2 or 1.
        min_length : int, optional
            Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
            to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
            A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
            Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
            an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
            (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        weights_as_mask : bool, optional
            If True, signifies that the input `weights` is the mask to use for fitting,
            which skips the continuous wavelet calculation and just smooths the input data.
            Default is False.
        pad_kwargs : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
            the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from convolution for the
            continuous wavelet transform. Default is None.

                The weight array used for fitting the data.

        Notes
        -----
        The classification of baseline points is similar to :meth:`~.Baseline.dietrich`, except that
        this method approximates the first derivative using a continous wavelet transform
        with the Haar wavelet, which is more robust than the numerical derivative in
        Dietrich's method.

        segments : int or Sequence[int, ...], optional
            Used to fit multiple convex hulls to the data to negate the effects of
            concave data. If the input is an integer, it sets the number of equally sized
            segments the data will be split into. If the input is a sequence, each integer
            in the sequence will be the index that splits two segments, which allows
            constructing unequally sized segments. Default is 1, which fits a single convex
            hull to the data.
        lam : float or None, optional
            The smoothing parameter for interpolating the baseline points using
            Whittaker smoothing. Set to 0 or None to use linear interpolation instead.
            Default is None, which does not smooth.
        diff_order : int, optional
            The order of the differential matrix if using Whittaker smoothing. Must
            be greater than 0. Default is 2 (second order differential matrix).
            Typical values are 2 or 1.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
            to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
            an effect; all non-zero values are considered potential baseline points. If None
            (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        smooth_half_window : int or None, optional
            The half window to use for smoothing the input data with a moving average
            before calculating the convex hull, which gives much better results for
            noisy data. Set to None (default) or 0 to not smooth the data.
        pad_kwargs : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding

        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.

    half_window : int, optional
        The half-window to use for the rolling maximum and rolling minimum calculations.
        Should be approximately equal to the full-width-at-half-maximum of the peaks or
        features in the data. Default is None, which will use half of the value from
        :func:`.optimize_window`, which is not always a good value, but at least scales
        with the number of data points and gives a starting point for tuning the parameter.
    num_std : float, optional

        will assign more points as baseline. Default is 3.0.
    sections : int, optional
        The number of sections to divide the input data into for finding the minimum
        standard deviation. Default is 32.
    smooth_half_window : int, optional
        The half window to use for smoothing the interpolated baseline with a moving average.
        Default is None, which will use `half_window`. Set to 0 to not smooth the baseline.
    interp_half_window : int, optional
        When interpolating between baseline segments, will use the average of

        to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
        an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None

    min_length : int, optional
        Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
        to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
        A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.

        Default is 1e-3.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
        to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
        an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
        (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    return_coef : bool, optional
        If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
        a form that fits the input `x_data` and return them in the params dictionary.
        Default is False, since the conversion takes time.
    min_length : int, optional
        Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
        to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
        A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
        Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
    pad_kwargs : dict, optional
        A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
        the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from smoothing. Default is None.
    **kwargs

        .. deprecated:: 1.2.0
            Passing additional keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in version
            1.4.0. Pass keyword arguments using `pad_kwargs`.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'mask': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The boolean array designating baseline points as True and peak points
            as False.
        * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order,)
            Only if `return_coef` is True and `max_iter` is greater than 0. The array
            of polynomial coefficients for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be
            used to create a polynomial using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`.
        * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
            Only if `max_iter` is greater than 1. An array containing the calculated
            tolerance values for each iteration. The length of the array is the number
            of iterations completed. If the last value in the array is greater than
            the input `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

    Notes
    -----
    When choosing parameters, first choose a `smooth_half_window` that appropriately
    smooths the data, and then reduce `num_std` until no peak regions are included in
    the baseline. If no value of `num_std` works, change `smooth_half_window` and repeat.

    If `max_iter` is 0, the baseline is simply a linear interpolation of the identified
    baseline points. Otherwise, a polynomial is iteratively fit through the baseline
    points, and the interpolated sections are replaced each iteration with the polynomial
    fit.

    min_fwhm : int, optional
        After creating the interpolated baseline, any region where the baseline
        is greater than the data for `min_fwhm` consecutive points will have an additional
        baseline point added and reinterpolated. Should be set to approximately the

        The first argument is the number of points that the returned vector
        will have (len(wavelet(length,width)) == length).
        The second is a width parameter, defining the size of the wavelet
        (e.g. standard deviation of a gaussian). See `ricker`, which
        satisfies these requirements.
    widths : Sequence[scalar, ...]
        Widths to use for transform with length `M`.
    dtype : type or numpy.dtype, optional
        The desired data type of output. Defaults to ``float64`` if the
        output of `wavelet` is real and ``complex128`` if it is complex.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to wavelet function.

    Returns
    -------
    cwt: numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
        Will have shape of (len(widths), len(data)).

    Notes
    -----
    This function was deprecated from scipy.signal in version 1.12.

    Fully automatic baseline correction (fabc).

    Similar to Dietrich's method, except that the derivative is estimated using a
    continuous wavelet transform and the baseline is calculated using Whittaker
    smoothing through the identified baseline points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    lam : float, optional
        The smoothing parameter. Larger values will create smoother baselines.
        Default is 1e6.
    scale : int, optional
        The scale at which to calculate the continuous wavelet transform. Should be
        approximately equal to the index-based full-width-at-half-maximum of the peaks
        or features in the data. Default is None, which will use half of the value from
        :func:`.optimize_window`, which is not always a good value, but at least scales
        with the number of data points and gives a starting point for tuning the parameter.
    num_std : float, optional
        The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Higher values
        will assign more points as baseline. Default is 3.0.
    diff_order : int, optional
        The order of the differential matrix. Must be greater than 0. Default is 2
        (second order differential matrix). Typical values are 2 or 1.
    min_length : int, optional
        Any region of consecutive baseline points less than `min_length` is considered
        to be a false positive and all points in the region are converted to peak points.
        A higher `min_length` ensures less points are falsely assigned as baseline points.
        Default is 2, which only removes lone baseline points.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
        to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
        an effect; all non-zero values are considered baseline points. If None
        (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    weights_as_mask : bool, optional
        If True, signifies that the input `weights` is the mask to use for fitting,
        which skips the continuous wavelet calculation and just smooths the input data.
        Default is False.
    x_data : array-like, optional
        The x-values. Not used by this function, but input is allowed for consistency
        with other functions.
    pad_kwargs : dict, optional
        A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
        the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from convolution for the
        continuous wavelet transform. Default is None.
    **kwargs

        .. deprecated:: 1.2.0
            Passing additional keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in version
            1.4.0. Pass keyword arguments using `pad_kwargs`.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'mask': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The boolean array designating baseline points as True and peak points
            as False.
        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data.

    Notes
    -----
    The classification of baseline points is similar to :meth:`~.Baseline.dietrich`, except that
    this method approximates the first derivative using a continous wavelet transform
    with the Haar wavelet, which is more robust than the numerical derivative in
    Dietrich's method.

    Identifies baseline points by fitting a convex hull to the bottom of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 with N points.
    segments : int or array-like[int], optional
        Used to fit multiple convex hulls to the data to negate the effects of
        concave data. If the input is an integer, it sets the number of equally sized
        segments the data will be split into. If the input is an array-like, each integer
        in the array will be the index that splits two segments, which allows
        constructing unequally sized segments. Default is 1, which fits a single convex
        hull to the data.
    lam : float or None, optional
        The smoothing parameter for interpolating the baseline points using
        Whittaker smoothing. Set to 0 or None to use linear interpolation instead.
        Default is None, which does not smooth.
    diff_order : int, optional
        The order of the differential matrix if using Whittaker smoothing. Must
        be greater than 0. Default is 2 (second order differential matrix).
        Typical values are 2 or 1.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array, used to override the function's baseline identification
        to designate peak points. Only elements with 0 or False values will have
        an effect; all non-zero values are considered potential baseline points. If None
        (default), then will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    smooth_half_window : int or None, optional
        The half window to use for smoothing the input data with a moving average
        before calculating the convex hull, which gives much better results for
        noisy data. Set to None (default) or 0 to not smooth the data.
    pad_kwargs : dict, optional
        A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to :func:`.pad_edges` for padding
        the edges of the data to prevent edge effects from smoothing. Default is None.
