        Fits a polynomial baseline using a non-quadratic cost function.

        The non-quadratic cost functions penalize residuals with larger values,

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (N,)
            The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
        poly_order : int, optional
            The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 2.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations. Default is 250.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array. If None (default), then will be an array with
            size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        cost_function : str, optional
            The non-quadratic cost function to minimize. Must indicate symmetry of the
            method by prepending 'a' or 'asymmetric' for asymmetric loss, and 's' or
            'symmetric' for symmetric loss. Default is 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'.
            Available methods, and their associated reference, are:

            * 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'[1]_
            * 'symmetric_truncated_quadratic'[1]_
            * 'asymmetric_huber'[1]_
            * 'symmetric_huber'[1]_
            * 'asymmetric_indec'[2]_
            * 'symmetric_indec'[2]_

        threshold : float, optional
            The threshold value for the loss method, where the function goes from
            quadratic loss (such as used for least squares) to non-quadratic. For
            symmetric loss methods, residual values with absolute value less than
            threshold will have quadratic loss. For asymmetric loss methods, residual
            values less than the threshold will have quadratic loss. Default is None,
            which sets `threshold` to one-tenth of the standard deviation of the input
            data.
        alpha_factor : float, optional
            A value between 0 and 1 that controls the value of the penalty. Default is
            0.99. Typically should not need to change this value.
        return_coef : bool, optional
            If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
            a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
            Default is False, since the conversion takes time.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.
            * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order + 1,)
                Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
                for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a
                polynomial using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if `alpha_factor` is not between 0 and 1.

        Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS).

        Performs polynomial regression at each data point using the nearest points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (N,)
            The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
        fraction : float, optional
            The fraction of N data points to include for the fitting on each point.
            Default is 0.2. Not used if `total_points` is not None.
        total_points : int, optional
            The total number of points to include for the fitting on each point. Default
            is None, which will use `fraction` * N to determine the number of points.
        scale : float, optional
            A scale factor applied to the weighted residuals to control the robustness
            of the fit. Default is 3.0, as used in [1]_. Note that the original loess
            procedure for smoothing in [2]_ used a `scale` of ~4.05.
        poly_order : int, optional
            The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 1.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations. Default is 10.
        symmetric_weights : bool, optional
            If False (default), will apply weighting asymmetrically, with residuals
            < 0 having a weight of 1, according to [1]_. If True, will apply weighting
            the same for both positive and negative residuals, which is regular LOESS.
            If `use_threshold` is True, this parameter is ignored.
        use_threshold : bool, optional
            If False (default), will compute weights each iteration to perform the
            robust fitting, which is regular LOESS. If True, will apply a threshold
            on the data being fit each iteration, based on the maximum values of the
            data and the fit baseline, as proposed by [3]_, similar to the modpoly
            and imodpoly techniques.
        num_std : float, optional
            The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Default
            is 1, which is the value used for the imodpoly technique. Only used if
            `use_threshold` is True.
        use_original : bool, optional
            If False (default), will compare the baseline of each iteration with
            the y-values of that iteration [4]_ when choosing minimum values for
            thresholding. If True, will compare the baseline with the original
            y-values given by `data` [5]_. Only used if `use_threshold` is True.
        weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
            The weighting array. If None (default), then will be an array with
            size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        return_coef : bool, optional
            If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
            a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
            Default is False, since the conversion takes time.
        conserve_memory : bool, optional
            If False, will cache the distance-weighted kernels for each value
            in `x_data` on the first iteration and reuse them on subsequent iterations to
            save time. The shape of the array of kernels is (len(`x_data`), `total_points`).
            If True (default), will recalculate the kernels each iteration, which uses very
            little memory, but is slower. Can usually set to False unless `x_data` and`total_points`
            are quite large and the function causes memory issues when cacheing the kernels. If
            numba is installed, there is no significant time difference since the calculations are
            sped up.
        delta : float, optional
            If `delta` is > 0, will skip all but the last x-value in the range `x_last + delta`,
            where `x_last` is the last x-value to be fit using weighted least squares, and instead
            use linear interpolation to calculate the fit for those x-values, which can
            significantly reduce the calculation time (same behavior as in
            statsmodels [6]_ and Cleveland's original Fortran lowess implementation [7]_).
            Fits all x-values if `delta` is <= 0. Default is None, which sets `delta` to
            `0.01 * (max(x_data) - min(x_data))`.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
                The weight array used for fitting the data. Does NOT contain the
                individual distance-weighted kernels for each x-value.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.
            * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (N, poly_order + 1)
                Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
                for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a polynomial
                using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`. If `delta` is > 0,
                the coefficients for any skipped x-value will all be 0.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if the number of points per window for the fitting is less than
            `poly_order` + 1 or greater than the total number of points, or if the
            values in `self.x` are not strictly increasing.

        Notes
        -----
        The iterative, robust, aspect of the fitting can be achieved either through
        reweighting based on the residuals (the typical usage), or thresholding the
        fit data based on the residuals, as proposed by [3]_, similar to the modpoly
        and imodpoly techniques.

        In baseline literature, this procedure is sometimes called "rbe", meaning
        "robust baseline estimate".

        data : array-like, shape (N,)
            The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
        poly_order : int, optional
            The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 2.
        quantile : float, optional
            The quantile at which to fit the baseline. Default is 0.05.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria. Default is 1e-6. For extreme quantiles (`quantile` < 0.01
            or `quantile` > 0.99), may need to use a lower value to get a good fit.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations. Default is 250. For extreme quantiles
            (`quantile` < 0.01 or `quantile` > 0.99), may need to use a higher value to
            ensure convergence.

        eps : float, optional
            A small value added to the square of the residual to prevent dividing by 0.
            Default is None, which uses the square of the maximum-absolute-value of the
            fit each iteration multiplied by 1e-6.

            If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to

            ('a' or 'asymmetric') is optional (eg. 'indec' and 'a_indec' are the same). Default
            is 'asymmetric_indec'. Available methods, and their associated reference, are:

            * 'asymmetric_indec'[1]_
            * 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'[2]_
            * 'asymmetric_huber'[2]_

        peak_ratio : float, optional
            A value between 0 and 1 that designates how many points in the data belong
            to peaks. Values are valid within ~10% of the actual peak ratio. Default is 0.5.
        alpha_factor : float, optional
            A value between 0 and 1 that controls the value of the penalty. Default is
            0.99. Typically should not need to change this value.
        tol_2 : float, optional
            The exit criteria for the difference between the optimal up-down ratio (number of
            points above 0 in the residual compared to number of points below 0) and the up-down
            ratio for a given threshold value. Default is 1e-3.
        tol_3 : float, optional
            The exit criteria for the relative change in the threshold value. Default is 1e-6.
        max_iter_2 : float, optional
            The number of iterations for iterating between different threshold values.
            Default is 100.
        return_coef : bool, optional
            If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
            a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
            Default is False, since the conversion takes time.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray, shape (J, K)
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for each iteration
                of both threshold values and fit values. Index 0 are the tolerence values
                for the difference in up-down ratios, index 1 are the tolerance values for
                the relative change in the threshold, and indices >= 2 are the tolerance values
                for each fit. All values that were not used in fitting have values of 0. Shape J
                is 2 plus the number of iterations for the threshold to converge (related to
                `max_iter_2`, `tol_2`, `tol_3`), and shape K is the maximum of the number of
                iterations for the threshold and the maximum number of iterations for all of
                the fits of the various threshold values (related to `max_iter` and `tol`).
            * 'threshold' : float
                The optimal threshold value. Could be used in :meth:`~.Baseline.penalized_poly`
                for fitting other similar data.
            * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order + 1,)
                Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
                for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a
                polynomial using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if `alpha_factor` or `peak_ratio` are not between 0 and 1, or if the
            specified cost function is symmetric.

    The Indec non-quadratic cost function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residual : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The residual array.
    threshold : float, optional
        Any residual values below the threshold are given quadratic loss.

    symmetric : bool, optional
        If True (default), the cost function is symmetric and applies the same
        weighting for positive and negative values. If False, will apply weights
        asymmetrically so that only positive weights are given the non-quadratic

    Fits a polynomial baseline using a non-quadratic cost function.

    The non-quadratic cost functions penalize residuals with larger values,
    giving a more robust fit compared to normal least-squares.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 with N points.
    poly_order : int, optional
        The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 2.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations. Default is 250.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array. If None (default), then will be an array with
        size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    cost_function : str, optional
        The non-quadratic cost function to minimize. Must indicate symmetry of the
        method by prepending 'a' or 'asymmetric' for asymmetric loss, and 's' or
        'symmetric' for symmetric loss. Default is 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'.
        Available methods, and their associated reference, are:

        * 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'[7]_
        * 'symmetric_truncated_quadratic'[7]_
        * 'asymmetric_huber'[7]_
        * 'symmetric_huber'[7]_
        * 'asymmetric_indec'[8]_
        * 'symmetric_indec'[8]_

    threshold : float, optional
        The threshold value for the loss method, where the function goes from
        quadratic loss (such as used for least squares) to non-quadratic. For
        symmetric loss methods, residual values with absolute value less than
        threshold will have quadratic loss. For asymmetric loss methods, residual
        values less than the threshold will have quadratic loss. Default is None,
        which sets `threshold` to one-tenth of the standard deviation of the input
        data.
    alpha_factor : float, optional
        A value between 0 and 1 that controls the value of the penalty. Default is
        0.99. Typically should not need to change this value.
    return_coef : bool, optional
        If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
        a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
        Default is False, since the conversion takes time.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data.
        * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
            An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
            each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
            completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
            `tol` value, then the function did not converge.
        * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order + 1,)
            Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
            for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a
            polynomial using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if `alpha_factor` is not between 0 and 1.

    scale : float, optional
        A scale factor applied to the weighted residuals to control the

    symmetric : bool, optional
        If False (default), will apply weighting asymmetrically, with residuals

    """
    Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS).

    Performs polynomial regression at each data point using the nearest points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 with N points.
    fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of N data points to include for the fitting on each point.
        Default is 0.2. Not used if `total_points` is not None.
    total_points : int, optional
        The total number of points to include for the fitting on each point. Default
        is None, which will use `fraction` * N to determine the number of points.
    scale : float, optional
        A scale factor applied to the weighted residuals to control the robustness
        of the fit. Default is 3.0, as used in [9]_. Note that the original loess
        procedure in [10]_ used a `scale` of ~4.05.
    poly_order : int, optional
        The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 1.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations. Default is 10.
    symmetric_weights : bool, optional
        If False (default), will apply weighting asymmetrically, with residuals
        < 0 having a weight of 1, according to [9]_. If True, will apply weighting
        the same for both positive and negative residuals, which is regular LOESS.
        If `use_threshold` is True, this parameter is ignored.
    use_threshold : bool, optional
        If False (default), will compute weights each iteration to perform the
        robust fitting, which is regular LOESS. If True, will apply a threshold
        on the data being fit each iteration, based on the maximum values of the
        data and the fit baseline, as proposed by [11]_, similar to the modpoly
        and imodpoly techniques.
    num_std : float, optional
        The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Default
        is 1, which is the value used for the imodpoly technique. Only used if
        `use_threshold` is True.
    use_original : bool, optional
        If False (default), will compare the baseline of each iteration with
        the y-values of that iteration [12]_ when choosing minimum values for
        thresholding. If True, will compare the baseline with the original
        y-values given by `data` [13]_. Only used if `use_threshold` is True.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array. If None (default), then will be an array with
        size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    return_coef : bool, optional
        If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
        a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
        Default is False, since the conversion takes time.
    conserve_memory : bool, optional
        If False, will cache the distance-weighted kernels for each value
        in `x_data` on the first iteration and reuse them on subsequent iterations to
        save time. The shape of the array of kernels is (len(`x_data`), `total_points`).
        If True (default), will recalculate the kernels each iteration, which uses very
        little memory, but is slower. Can usually set to False unless `x_data` and`total_points`
        are quite large and the function causes memory issues when cacheing the kernels. If
        numba is installed, there is no significant time difference since the calculations are
        sped up.
    delta : float, optional
        If `delta` is > 0, will skip all but the last x-value in the range `x_last + delta`,
        where `x_last` is the last x-value to be fit using weighted least squares, and instead
        use linear interpolation to calculate the fit for those x-values, which can
        significantly reduce the calculation time (same behavior as in
        statsmodels [14]_ and Cleveland's original Fortran lowess implementation [15]_).
        Fits all x-values if `delta` is <= 0. Default is None, which sets `delta` to
        `0.01 * (max(x_data) - min(x_data))`.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data. Does NOT contain the
            individual distance-weighted kernels for each x-value.
        * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
            An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
            each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
            completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
            `tol` value, then the function did not converge.
        * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (N, poly_order + 1)
            Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
            for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a polynomial
            using :class:`numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial`. If `delta` is > 0,
            the coefficients for any skipped x-value will all be 0.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if the number of points per window for the fitting is less than
        `poly_order` + 1 or greater than the total number of points.

    Notes
    -----
    The iterative, robust, aspect of the fitting can be achieved either through
    reweighting based on the residuals (the typical usage), or thresholding the
    fit data based on the residuals, as proposed by [11]_, similar to the modpoly
    and imodpoly techniques.

    In baseline literature, this procedure is sometimes called "rbe", meaning
    "robust baseline estimate".

    cost_function : str, optional
        The non-quadratic cost function to minimize. Unlike :meth:`~.Baseline.penalized_poly`,
        this function only works with asymmetric cost functions, so the symmetry prefix
        ('a' or 'asymmetric') is optional (eg. 'indec' and 'a_indec' are the same). Default

            for the difference in up-down ratios, index 1 are the tolerance values for
            the relative change in the threshold, and indices >= 2 are the tolerance values
            for each fit. All values that were not used in fitting have values of 0. Shape J
            is 2 plus the number of iterations for the threshold to converge (related to
            `max_iter_2`, `tol_2`, `tol_3`), and shape K is the maximum of the number of
            iterations for the threshold and the maximum number of iterations for all of
            the fits of the various threshold values (related to `max_iter` and `tol`).
        * 'threshold' : float
            The optimal threshold value. Could be used in :meth:`~.Baseline.penalized_poly`
            for fitting other similar data.
        * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order + 1,)
