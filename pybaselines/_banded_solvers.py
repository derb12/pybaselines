    """
    Pentadiagonal banded matrix solver using transformations and backward substitution.

    Solves the equation ``A @ x = rhs``, given `A` in LAPACK banded format as `lhs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lhs : numpy.ndarray, shape (5, N)
        The pentadiagonal matrix `A` in LAPACK banded format banded format (see
        :func:`scipy.linalg.solve_banded`).
    rhs : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The right-hand side of the equation.
    overwrite_ab : bool, optional
        Whether to overwrite `lhs` when solving. Default is False.
    overwrite_b : bool, optional
        Whether to overwrite `rhs` when solving. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    out : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The solution to the linear system, `x`.
    int
        If the matrix is singular, the returned integer is the row index plus one of where
        the singularity occurred. Otherwise, returns 0.

    Notes
    -----
    Derived from ``pentapy`` (https://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/pentapy), with modifications
    following pentapy issue #11 and pentapy pull request #27 for faster indexing and better error
    handling.

    Uses `lhs` in LAPACK banded format rather than the row-wise banded format used by pentapy.
