        Considers the data as a mixture model composed of noise and peaks.

        Weights are iteratively assigned by calculating the probability each value in
        the residual belongs to a normal distribution representing the noise.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (M, N)
            The y-values of the measured data. Must not contain missing data (NaN) or Inf.
        lam : float or Sequence[float, float], optional
            The smoothing parameter for the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Larger values will create smoother
            baselines. Default is 1e3.
        p : float, optional
            The penalizing weighting factor. Must be between 0 and 1. Values greater
            than the baseline will be given `p` weight, and values less than the baseline
            will be given `1 - p` weight. Used to set the initial weights before performing
            expectation-maximization. Default is 1e-2.
        num_knots : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The number of knots for the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a
            single value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 25.
        spline_degree : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The degree of the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 3, which is a cubic spline.
        diff_order : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The order of the differential matrix for the rows and columns, respectively. If
            a single value is given, both will use the same value. Must be greater than 0.
            Default is 3 (third order differential matrix). Typical values are 2 or 3.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The max number of fit iterations. Default is 50.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
        weights : array-like, shape (M, N), optional
            The weighting array. If None (default), then the initial weights
            will be an array with shape equal to (M, N) and all values set to 1, and then
            two iterations of reweighted least-squares are performed to provide starting
            weights for the expectation-maximization of the mixture model.
        symmetric : bool, optional
            If False (default), the total mixture model will be composed of one normal
            distribution for the noise and one uniform distribution for positive non-noise
            residuals. If True, an additional uniform distribution will be added to the
            mixture model for negative non-noise residuals. Only need to set `symmetric`
            to True when peaks are both positive and negative.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if p is not between 0 and 1.

        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if `p` is not between 0 and 1 or if `diff_order` is less than 2.

        lam : float or Sequence[float, float], optional
            The smoothing parameter for the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Larger values will create smoother
            baselines. Default is 1e3.
        num_knots : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The number of knots for the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a
            single value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 25.
        spline_degree : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The degree of the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 3, which is a cubic spline.

        normalize_weights : bool, optional
            If True, will normalize the computed weights between 0 and 1 to potentially
            improve the numerical stabilty. Set to False (default) to use the original
            implementation, which sets weights for all negative residuals to be greater than 1.

        A penalized spline version of the brPLS algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array-like, shape (M, N)
            The y-values of the measured data. Must not contain missing data (NaN) or Inf.
        lam : float or Sequence[float, float], optional
            The smoothing parameter for the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Larger values will create smoother
            baselines. Default is 1e3.
        num_knots : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The number of knots for the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a
            single value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 25.
        spline_degree : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The degree of the splines along the rows and columns, respectively. If a single
            value is given, both will use the same value. Default is 3, which is a cubic spline.
        diff_order : int or Sequence[int, int], optional
            The order of the differential matrix for the rows and columns, respectively. If
            a single value is given, both will use the same value. Must be greater than 0.
            Default is 2 (second order differential matrix). Typical values are 1 or 2.
        max_iter : int, optional
            The max number of fit iterations. Default is 50.
        tol : float, optional
            The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
        max_iter_2 : float, optional
            The number of iterations for updating the proportion of data occupied by peaks.
            Default is 50.
        tol_2 : float, optional
            The exit criteria for the difference between the calculated proportion of data
            occupied by peaks. Default is 1e-3.
        weights : array-like, shape (M, N), optional
            The weighting array. If None (default), then the initial weights
            will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.

        Returns
        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The calculated baseline.
        params : dict
            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.
            * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray, shape (J, K)
                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for each iteration of
                both threshold values and fit values. Index 0 are the tolerence values for
                the difference in the peak proportion, and indices >= 1 are the tolerance values
                for each fit. All values that were not used in fitting have values of 0. Shape J
                is 2 plus the number of iterations for the threshold to converge (related to
                `max_iter_2`, `tol_2`), and shape K is the maximum of the number of
                iterations for the threshold and the maximum number of iterations for all of
                the fits of the various threshold values (related to `max_iter` and `tol`).

            will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.
        alternate_weighting : bool, optional
            If False (default), the weighting uses a prefactor term of ``10^t``, where ``t`` is
            the iteration number, which is equation 8 within the LSRPLS paper [1]_. If True, uses
            a prefactor term of ``exp(t)``. See the Notes section below for more details.

        -------
        baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The calculated baseline.

            A dictionary with the following items:

            * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
                The weight array used for fitting the data.

                An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
                each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
                completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
                `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

        Notes
        -----
        In the LSRPLS paper [1]_, the weighting equation is written with a prefactor term
        of ``10^t``, where ``t`` is the iteration number, but the plotted weighting curve in
        Figure 1 of the paper shows a prefactor term of ``exp(t)`` instead. Since it is ambiguous
        which prefactor term is actually used for the algorithm, both are permitted by setting
        `alternate_weighting` to True to use ``10^t`` and False to use ``exp(t)``. In practice,
        the prefactor determines how quickly the weighting curve converts from a sigmoidal curve
        to a step curve, and does not heavily influence the result.

        If ``alternate_weighting`` is False, the weighting is the same as the drPLS algorithm [2]_.
