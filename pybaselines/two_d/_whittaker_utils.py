    Performs the face-splitting product on the input two dimensional basis matrix.

    Parameters

class PenalizedSystem2D:
    """
    An object for setting up and solving penalized least squares linear systems.

    Attributes
    ----------
    diff_order : numpy.ndarray[int, int]
        The difference order of the penalty.
    main_diagonal : numpy.ndarray
        The values along the main diagonal of the penalty matrix.
    penalty : scipy.sparse.spmatrix or scipy.sparse.sparray
        The current penalty. Originally is `original_diagonals` after multiplying by `lam`
        and applying padding, but can also be changed by calling
        :meth:`~PenalizedSystem2D.add_penalty`. Reset by calling
        :meth:`~PenalizedSystem2D.reset_diagonals`.

    Notes
    -----
    If the penalty is symmetric, the sparse system could be solved much faster using
    CHOLMOD from SuiteSparse (https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) through
    the python bindings provided by scikit-sparse (https://github.com/scikit-sparse/scikit-sparse),
    but it is not worth implementing here since this code will rarely be used.

        Warns
        -----
        ParameterWarning
            If `num_eigens` is less than or equal to `diff_order`, a warning is issue since
            the diagonals of the resulting matrix will no longer be guaranteed to be
            positive-definite. Is also emitted if `num_eigens` is greater than 50 since
            for 2D baseline correction, less than 20 eigenvalues is typically required.

        Notes
        -----
        The lowest `diff_order` eigenvalues are supposed to be zero while they end up
        being ~ +- 1e-15, so their values are set to 0.

        The penalty matrix has a matrix rank (number of nonzero eigenvalues) of
        ``data_points - diff_order``. The lowest `diff_order` eigenvalues are all
        zero, so the system is not guaranteed to be positive definite when solving the
        penalized least squares fit unless all weights are >~ 1e-5 (just a guess, but
        the meaning is that weights must be some magnitude greater than zero), which is
        not guaranteed for all Whittaker-smoothing-based algorithms.

        Note that when `num_eigens` <= `diff_order`, the penalty becomes 0 due to the above,
        so it essentially becomes a weighted spline fit; since `lam` is not allowed to be 0,
        which would also cause this, then to maintain this convention, must not allow
        `num_eigens` <= `diff_order`.

        Solves the coefficients for a weighted penalized spline.

        Solves the linear equation ``(B.T @ W @ B + P) c = B.T @ W @ y`` for the spline
        coefficients, `c`, given the spline basis, `B`, the weights (diagonal of `W`), the
        penalty `P`, and `y`, and returns the resulting spline, ``B @ c``. Attempts to
        calculate ``B.T @ W @ B`` and ``B.T @ W @ y`` as a banded system to speed up
        the calculation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The y-values for fitting the spline.
        weights : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The weights for each y-value.
        penalty : numpy.ndarray, shape (``M * N``, ``M * N``)
            The finite difference penalty matrix, in LAPACK's lower banded format (see
            :func:`scipy.linalg.solveh_banded`) if `lower_only` is True or the full banded
            format (see :func:`scipy.linalg.solve_banded`) if `lower_only` is False.
        rhs_extra : float or numpy.ndarray, shape (``M * N``,), optional
            If supplied, `rhs_extra` will be added to the right hand side (``B.T @ W @ y``)
            of the equation before solving. Default is None, which adds nothing.

        Returns
        -------
        numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The spline, corresponding to ``B @ c``, where `c` are the solved spline
            coefficients and `B` is the spline basis.

        Notes
        -----
        Uses the more efficient algorithm from Eilers's paper, although the memory usage
        is higher than the straigtforward method when the number of eigenvalues is high; however,
        it is significantly faster and memory efficient when the number of eigenvalues is lower,
        which will be the more typical use case.
