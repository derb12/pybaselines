    """
    Object containing the information about the 2D B-spline design matrix.

    Attributes
    ----------
    basis_r : scipy.sparse.csr_matrix, shape (N, P)
        The spline basis for the rows. Has a shape of (`N,` `P`), where `N` is the number of
        points in `x`, and `P` is the number of basis functions (equal to ``K - spline_degree - 1``
        or equivalently ``num_knots[0] + spline_degree[0] - 1``).
    basis_c : scipy.sparse.csr_matrix, shape (M, Q)
        The spline basis for the columns. Has a shape of (`M,` `Q`), where `M` is the number of
        points in `z`, and `Q` is the number of basis functions (equal to ``K - spline_degree - 1``
        or equivalently ``num_knots[1] + spline_degree[1] - 1``).
    knots_r : numpy.ndarray, shape (K,)
        The knots for the spline along the rows. Has a shape of `K`, which is equal to
        ``num_knots[0] + 2 * spline_degree[0]``.
    knots_c : numpy.ndarray, shape (L,)
        The knots for the spline along the columns. Has a shape of `L`, which is equal to
        ``num_knots[1] + 2 * spline_degree[2]``.
    num_knots : numpy.ndarray([int, int])
        The number of internal knots (including the endpoints) for x and z. The total number of
        knots for the spline, `K`, is equal to ``num_knots + 2 * spline_degree``.
    spline_degree : numpy.ndarray([int, int])
        The degree of the spline (eg. a cubic spline would have a `spline_degree` of 3) for
        x and z.
    x : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The x-values for the spline.
    z : numpy.ndarray, shape (M,)
        The z-values for the spline.

class PSpline2D(PenalizedSystem2D):

    A Penalized Spline, which penalizes the difference of the spline coefficients.

    Penalized splines (P-Splines) are solved with the following equation
    ``(B.T @ W @ B + P) c = B.T @ W @ y`` where `c` is the spline coefficients, `B` is the
    spline basis, the weights are the diagonal of `W`, the penalty is `P`, and `y` is the
    fit data. The penalty `P` is usually in the form ``lam * D.T @ D``, where `lam` is a
    penalty factor and `D` is the matrix version of the finite difference operator.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef : None or numpy.ndarray, shape (M,)
        The spline coefficients. Is None if :meth:`~PSpline2D.solve_pspline` has not been called
        at least once.

    Notes
    -----
    If the penalty is symmetric, the sparse system could be solved much faster using
    CHOLMOD from SuiteSparse (https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) through
    the python bindings provided by scikit-sparse (https://github.com/scikit-sparse/scikit-sparse),
    but it is not worth implementing here since this code will rarely be used.

        Solves the coefficients for a weighted penalized spline.

        Solves the linear equation ``(B.T @ W @ B + P) c = B.T @ W @ y`` for the spline
        coefficients, `c`, given the spline basis, `B`, the weights (diagonal of `W`), the

        the calculation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The y-values for fitting the spline.
        weights : numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The weights for each y-value.
        penalty : numpy.ndarray, shape (``M * N``, ``M * N``)
            The finite difference penalty matrix, in LAPACK's lower banded format (see
            :func:`scipy.linalg.solveh_banded`) if `lower_only` is True or the full banded
            format (see :func:`scipy.linalg.solve_banded`) if `lower_only` is False.
        rhs_extra : float or numpy.ndarray, shape (``M * N``,), optional
            If supplied, `rhs_extra` will be added to the right hand side (``B.T @ W @ y``)
            of the equation before solving. Default is None, which adds nothing.

        Returns
        -------
        numpy.ndarray, shape (M, N)
            The spline, corresponding to ``B @ c``, where `c` are the solved spline
            coefficients and `B` is the spline basis.

        Notes
        -----
        Uses the more efficient algorithm from Eilers's paper, although the memory usage
        is higher than the straigtforward method when the number of knots is high; however,
        it is significantly faster and memory efficient when the number of knots is lower,
        which will be the more typical use case.
